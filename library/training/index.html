<h1>Chrisa Pappas Training</h1>

<h2 id="posts">Posts</h2>

<p>If you’ve used Wordpress before, adding posts is the same as you’re used to. From anywhere on the site using the header choose <code>New &gt; Post</code> or from the backend navigate to <code>Posts</code> on the left-hand-side sidebar and click <code>New Post</code>.</p>

<h3>Editing Content</h3>

<p>When editing content, there are a few things to keep in mind to ensure the post looks great and is readable to search engines. </p>

<h4>Headers</h4>

<p>These are <code>H1</code>, <code>H2</code>, <code>H3</code>, <code>H4</code>, <code>H5</code> &amp; <code>H6</code></p>

<p>Headers describe hierarchy to search engines, so an <code>H1</code> provides canonical information that’s <em>more important</em> than <code>H2-H6</code>, as a result there should only be one <code>H1</code> per page or post. For posts, the title is the <code>H1</code> so you’ll never need to add an <code>H1</code> to a post.</p>

<p>For example of the heirachry mentioned: this document. The title is <strong>Chrisa Pappas Training</strong> and that’s an <code>H1</code>. You’ll see the title <strong>Posts,</strong> (an <code>H2</code>) within which all content has to do with posts — there’s a title <strong>Editing Content</strong> and that’s an <code>H3</code>. Finally, you get to the <strong>Headers</strong> section, which is the one we’re in now and that’s an <code>H4</code>. Content is separated in a way that gives context to a reader and to a search engine, and the size/style of the headers give a visual cue to readers as to how things are organized.</p>

<p>Since headers have predefined styles, don’t ad any Italic or Bold styles to them.</p>

<h4>Images</h4>

<p><strong>Featured Image</strong></p>

<p>This is the image on the right-hand side of the post-editor page, feel free to upload a large image, the server will automatically resize it when you load the page. Since this is used in quite a few places, be sure to upload an image here.</p>

<p><strong>Custom Images</strong></p>

<p>There are two custom image sizes that you can optimize to look their best:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Grid Image - <code>800px x 920px</code>. This is the image you see when there’s a grid of posts (homepage, post pages etc.</li>
	<li>The Pinned Post Image - <code>1260px x 860px</code>. This is the image that displays on the pinned post section on the homepage. Even if you’re not going to pin a post, you should upload this image because it can still be displayed if it’s the most recent post. </li>
</ul>

<p>You don’t <em>need</em> to upload these—we re-size the featured image if they’re not available—but it’s not foolproof, sometimes faces will be cropped since it’s programmatically cropping.</p>

<p><strong>Content Images</strong></p>

<p>When uploading images, Wordpress conveniently re-sizes them so you can display different images at different screen resolutions. The image size that you’ll want to choose to the content-area (the blog-post itself) is <code>Large - 1380px</code> the height is automatically determined by the image size, so that will be different. This should be selected by default so you most likely won’t need to worry about it. No need to align images to the center, left or right — set them to <code>No Alignment</code>.</p>

<h3>Pinning Posts</h3>

<p>The pinned post on the homepage is a good way to display content that you want readers to see first for a short time when it would otherwise be swept into the feed behind newer posts.</p>

<p>The pinned post section will display the <strong>most recent pinned post that <em>hasn’t expired.</em></strong> If there are no pinned posts to display the site will <strong>automatically display the most recent post whether or not it’s a pinned post</strong>. </p>

<p>So if you have an event that you would like to have pinned, but would like it to display as a normal post after the event has passed, just choose an expiration date after the event; the post will display in normal chronological order.</p>

<p>Options to pin a post are available while editing a post under <code>Post Fields &gt; Options</code>.</p>

<h2 id="site-options-defaults">Site Options &amp; Defaults</h2>

<p>From the dashboard, the left-hand-side menu item titled <code>Options</code> has a few site-wide settings. Most of them won’t need to be touched, but we like to add them as options for peace-of-mind.</p>

<p>They are as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Social Media</li>
	<li>Email Block - This is the signup form that people use, there’s a handful of code that you won’t want to touch but the title and subtitle are editable.</li>
	<li>Text - This has a text-field who’s content lives on the search-results page when search can’t find anything.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="menus">Menus</h2>

<p>The menu is very basic and runs off wordpress defaults, so you’re probably familiar with the way it works. Under the left-hand-side menu <code>Appearance &gt; Menus</code> you’ll see a simple UI to drag-and-drop pages into the navigation. </p>
